Spotify Guess Game ðŸŽµ

Welcome to the Spotify Guess Game, an interactive web application where users log in with their Spotify account, select a playlist, and engage in a guessing game based on their music preferences.
Features
1. Spotify Authentication

    Users can log in securely using their Spotify account.
    Once authenticated, the app fetches the user's playlists.

2. Playlist Fetching and Display

    After login, the app displays a list of user playlists fetched from Spotify.
    Each playlist is shown with:
        Its cover image
        Name
        Description
        A link to view it on Spotify

3. Default Playlist Selection

    Automatically selects "Your Top Songs 2024" as the default playlist, if available.
    If "Your Top Songs 2024" isn't available, users can manually select any playlist.

4. Responsive Design

    The app is optimized for different screen sizes:
        Grid layout for playlists on small, medium, and large screens.
        Easy navigation and clear visual hierarchy.

5. Interactive Playlist Selection

    Playlists are displayed as clickable cards.
    The selected playlist is highlighted, with details shown prominently below the grid.

6. Error Handling

    Displays appropriate error messages if playlists fail to load or if login fails.
